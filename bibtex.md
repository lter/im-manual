# Exporting Bibtex files for importing to the Network bibliography
LTER sites maintain records of their publications in different systems (Zotero, DEIMS, EndNote, custom databases), but everyone should be able to export a BibTex file. The LNO will accept files exported from non-Zotero systems as bibtex files and will handle de-duplication, aligning with DOI’s, and tagging, so that each publication is listed only once, but all associated sites are tagged.

Please name your file according to the following convention and send it to downs@nceas.ucsb.edu along with the date of the last network bibliography update:
XXX-pubs-YYYY-MM where XXX=site acronym; YYYY=Year; and MM=numeric month in which the file was exported.

## Identifying LTER Site

Please use the linked entry-types and fields when exporting your BibTex file. In addition to the required fields listed below under each entry type, please ensure that your export includes a keyword identifying your LTER site and one or both of two standard fields for linking to the product:

* LTER site keyword format (or tag in Zotero): LTER-XXX, where XXX=your three-letter site acronym
* DOI (if available) or URL (if available)
