# Getting Connected with Information Management

You're familiar with the LTER Network, but haven't worked as an information manager (IM) before. Here are a few things for you to know and do as you get started.

## Key Resources ##

* [**LTER Information Management System Guidelines**](https://lternet.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/LTER_IMS_Guidelines_V2_1_20180103.pdf) lays out the basic tasks and responsibilities of all LTER Information Managers.
* [**Data Package Best Practices**](https://ediorg.github.io/data-package-best-practices/) has recommendations for formatting data packages of various types including non-tabular data, and for using the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) to describe those data packages.
* [**IM Bylaws**](https://lternet.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-06-11-LTER_IMC_Bylaws_v4_final.pdf): The LTER Network is a highly distributed organization, but the Network also depends on information managers working together across sites as a team. The IM Committee bylaws describe how the committee runs, how its leadership (IMExec) is chosen, and what the expectations are of its member IMs.
* [**Website Design and Content Guidelines**](https://lternet.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guidelines-for-LTER-Web-Site-Design-and-Content-revised-2018-05-17.pdf) lays out general guidelines for designing site websites. While each individual LTER site needs to fit into the structure of its parent organization(s) and uses different backend technology, all sites should maintain some common types of information. 
* [**IM document archive**](https://lternet.edu/lter-document-archive/?wpv-document-types%5B%5D=information-management&wpv_aux_current_post_id=87668&wpv_aux_parent_post_id=87668&wpv_sort_orderby=post_date&wpv_sort_order=desc&wpv_view_count=87950): Based within the larger LTER document archive, the IM document repository holds current and historical versions of bylaws, annual meeting reports, working group reports and other information, which can be remarkably useful in understanding the context of the Network. 
* [**Environmental Data Initiative**](https://edirepository.org/): Once the data arm of the LTER Network Office, the Environmental Data Initiative is now LTER's primary data partner and also serves a myriad of other NSF programs in Environmental Biology. In addition to data curation and infrastructure, EDI provides information management training, resources, and leadership in data harmonization for synthesis.
* [**Retired IM website**](https://spinks.kbs.msu.edu/) (login: im / pw: lter): For several years, the LTER information management community maintained a website separate from the main lternet.edu website. With the advent of EDI and its broader community resources, much of the material maintained on the old im.lternet.edu website was moved to [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/), while the LTER GitHub and Google drive supplanted the LTER-specific materials. A static copy of the old *IM* site is maintained at https://spinks.kbs.msu.edu/ (use login im and password lter) for reference, thanks to Sven Bohm. 

## Working in a Connected Community ##

* **Virtual Water Coolers**: The Information Management Committee meets monthly on the second Monday of each month at noon, Pacific time. The zoom link (always the same) will be emailed to everyone on the IM email list a day or two before the meeting. Regular attendance at these "Virtual Watercoolers" is expected of all LTER information managers. Plus, it will really help you learn your way around the network, connect to colleagues, and stay painlessly up-to-date.
* **IM Annual Meeting**: Once a year, in summer or early fall, the entire group of information managers meets either in person or online to reconnect, move projects forward, and discuss new directions. These meetings usually take place in association with the LTER All Scientists Meeting or the meeting of a related society such as the Earth Science Information Partners or the Ecological Society of America. Reports from past annual meetings are found in the [document archive](https://lternet.edu/?taxonomy=document-types&term=information-management).
* [**IM Committee on LTER Community Forum**](https://lternet.discourse.group/g/information-mgrs?asc=true): Please join the LTER Community Forum and request to join the Information Managers Group and watch the Information Management category to take part in IM discussions and connect with colleagues. 
* [**Shared Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AABt1FqIzosUUk9PVA): The LTER-committee-information-management google drive contains active working documents related to IM working groups, IM Exec, Committee Meetings, recordings of recent Virtual Water Coolers and other active resources. Once documents are finalized or working groups complete their activities, long term records move to the document archive. LTER Network Office Staff or current IM Exec members can add new LTER Information Managers to the shared google drive.  
*  [**LTER GitHub**](https://github.com/lter): Many repositories house current and past programming projects of the LTER Network and its data partner, the Environmental Data Initiative.  (Do start with the index, as there are a wide variety of projects in various stages of maintenance.) This manual is also maintained in a GitHub repo, where all LTER information managers can [make suggestions](https://lter.github.io/im-manual/edits) for additions or updates.
