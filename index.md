# LTER Information Management Manual

This manual gathers in one place the current practices and procedures that apply to information management **within the LTER Network**. It does not aspire to be a single source of information and resources for information management more generally -- nor even for the myriad best practices that have been established through IM collaboration in the LTER Network.
